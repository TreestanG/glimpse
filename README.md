# Glimpse

Glimpse is a VC pitch simulator. Imagine pitching to a VC until you get it right.

Its main feature is a 1-on-1 call to VC. It responds exactly like how a VC would respond, offering live feedback and offers questions mid-call. Afterwards, we provide analytics and insights to your call telling you how to improve.
